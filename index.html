        It could be said that Michael Jordan was the genesis of basketball as we
        know it today. Throughout a fiery and storied career, the tireless MJ
        overcame his hurdles, soaring above challenge after challenge to realize
        the unexpected. Along the way, he redefined basketball's relationship to
        style, the sport's connection to youth counter-culture and the game's
        creative potential.

        Like Jordan himself, his eponymous footwear arrived with a bang, sharing
        its namesake's tradition-breaking bravado. A black and red colorway
        violated the league's uniform policy, earning a stern letter from league
        officials and generating a $5,000 fine each time the player wore the
        shoes on court. It is with this brazen charisma that the Air Jordan
        lineage was born.
